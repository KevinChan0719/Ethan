We are going to upgrade Bitcoinpay's mainnet in the following May, 2019, in which we'll change the algorithm from POW to POS in order to fix a variety of security problems resulted from computing fluctuations as well as to avoid computing resources waste. After upgrading, Bitcoinpay is able to support smart contract, which can avoid centralization by oligarchic combination much more better. And currently BTP's main transaction is on zb.com exchange platform and we will be listed on other major exchanges after this mainnet upgrading.
